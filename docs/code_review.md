# Code Architecture

**Last Updated:** December 2025

## Overview

Sugar Splash is a Phaser 3 match-3 game using ES6 modules. The codebase follows a manager pattern where GameScene orchestrates specialized manager classes.

## Architecture

### Manager Pattern

Each manager follows a consistent pattern:

```javascript
export default class XxxManager {
    constructor(scene, ...dependencies) {
        this.scene = scene;
        // Initialize state
    }

    create() { /* Build UI if needed */ }

    // Public methods...

    destroy() {
        // Cleanup timers, tweens, references
        this.scene = null;
    }
}
```

### Key Patterns

1. **Async/Await Cascades** - ActionProcessor handles match-3 chain reactions with proper sequencing
2. **Event-Driven Updates** - Score, objectives, UI update via Phaser events
3. **Procedural Generation** - All textures and sounds generated at runtime (no external assets)
4. **Composition** - GameScene composes managers rather than inheriting behavior

### Data Flow

```
User Input → Board → ActionProcessor → Events → Managers → UI Updates
                ↓
           MatchLogic (match detection)
                ↓
           Candy sprites (visual state)
```

## Technical Decisions

### Procedural Assets
All textures created with Phaser Graphics API, sounds with WebAudio oscillators. Reduces load time and external dependencies.

### Manager Extraction
GameScene was refactored from ~1920 lines to ~520 lines by extracting:
- PowerupManager (482 lines)
- HUDManager (413 lines) - includes score counter animation
- DialogManager (389 lines) - includes settings dialogs
- HintManager (352 lines) - dual-candy highlighting with visibility cycling
- BonusRoundManager (256 lines)
- ParticleManager (120 lines)

### Audio Architecture
- **SoundManager** - WebAudio procedural synth for in-game music and SFX
- **C64Sequencer** - Authentic C64-style chiptune for menu screens, using PAL timing and SID-inspired synthesis

### Error Recovery
ActionProcessor uses try/catch/finally with re-entrancy protection. 10-second watchdog timer as last resort backup.

### Visual Effects
- **Color Bomb Lasers** - Beams shoot one-by-one to targets, all stay visible, then explode together
- **Score Animation** - Smooth counting up with pop effect and color flash
- **Hint System** - Pulsing rings on both candies, swap arrows between them, visibility cycles on/off
- **Menu Animations** - Floating candies, bouncing across screen, rising bubbles, sparkles, cursor trail

### Mobile Support
Touch input with swipe detection. Threshold-based gesture recognition distinguishes taps from swipes.
